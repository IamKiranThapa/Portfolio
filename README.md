Project-1: Build your own personal portfolio
This is my source code and all files of my first fully responsive personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This is like my online resume through which potential clients and hiring managers can easily find me online and checkout my previous projects and skills.
to avoid confusion ,I arranged the HTML, CSS and Javascript ,images of the project in their respective folders.
The HTML file goes in the root folder and the image,icon,css and javascript files will be in their seperate folders.
